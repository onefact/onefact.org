## Preface: Transparency

This page is a work in progress. It is a living document that will be updated as we learn more about the Once Upon program and its impact on people's lives. If you have any questions, please reach out to us at [hello@onefact.org](mailto:hello@onefact.org). If you don't want to read this page, that's totally cool ðŸ˜Š as we're not here to convince you of anything. We're here to share what we've learned and help you make your own decisions.

## Join us! 

Once upon uses storytelling principles from [Pixar](http://web.archive.org/web/20170208134519/http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) among evidence-based psychology literature. We are using these principles to continue telling this story -- feel free to sign up for the [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/onefact) if you want to follow along as we release the beginning, middle, and end of the story arc ;)
