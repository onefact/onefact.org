This week, I found myself in the vibrant city of NYC, ready to embark on an incredible journey cycling through all five boroughs alongside @onefact.org during the renowned Five Boro Bike Tour.


Let me tell you a bit about One Fact. They’re a tech non-profit increasing healthcare access and equity globally through open-source AI and they have received funding and support from institutions such as Columbia, Stanford, and the NIH.  


I ride as I’m acutely aware of the significance of informed decision-making when it comes to healthcare. It is crucial that we ensure everyone has access to the information they need to take care of their own well-being and self-advocate.


Your donations are not only tax-deductible but also directly contribute to One Fact's mission of making the change we need. Together, we can make a tangible impact and create a future where healthcare is accessible and equitable for all.


Join me on this journey by supporting One Fact and together let's make a lasting difference!
